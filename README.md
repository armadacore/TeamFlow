# TeamFlow

**TeamFlow** is a tool designed to simplify application development through a modular app system. It provides a flexible foundation for creating desktop applications that are secure and extendable.

## Project Status

TeamFlow is currently in an early development stage. The features implemented so far are only a starting point, and many more are planned for the future. Contributions from other developers are welcome to help move the development forward.

## Project Description

TeamFlow is designed to offer developers an easy way to create functional applications using reusable, modular components. A built-in app store is planned, which will allow users to browse and add additional modules (apps) to meet their specific requirements.

### Key Features (Planned)

- **Modularity:** Applications can be extended by integrating different apps.
- **Security Focus:** TeamFlow follows the `secure-by-default` principle, ensuring that applications are secure by design. User data is only collected when explicitly consented to.
- **Flexible Resource Access:** Controlled access to core resources like databases, the filesystem, networks, and other functionalities will be provided.
- **Ease of Extensibility:** The platform will provide interfaces to develop your own apps and integrate them into the app store.

### Objective

The goal of TeamFlow is to create a platform that allows developers to focus on the core functionalities of their applications while essential building blocks (like data access and security) are handled by the platform itself.

## Technologies

TeamFlow is built using the following technologies:

- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/):** A framework for building secure and lightweight desktop applications.
- **[Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos):** A Rust library for reactive web and desktop interfaces.
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):** A programming language known for its safety, performance, and reliability.

## Target Audience

TeamFlow is aimed at developers who are looking for a secure, modular, and flexible foundation for building desktop applications.

## Contributing

Developers who feel passionate about TeamFlow and want to help shape the project are warmly invited to contribute. Any kind of help — whether through improvements, new ideas, or fixing bugs — is welcome.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Project:** Create a fork of the TeamFlow repository.
2. **Make Your Changes:** Work on the changes or improvements you wish to implement.
3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to propose your changes for discussion and possible inclusion in the project.
4. **Provide Feedback:** If you're not ready to code just yet, feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or report bugs using the issue tracker.

My goal is to build a small, engaged community around TeamFlow. If you're interested in developing any of the planned features or have your own ideas to bring to the table, it would be fantastic to have you onboard!

## Installation and Setup

TeamFlow is still in development, and no stable release is currently available. Developers who want to contribute can set up the environment as follows:

1. Install **Rust** via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Make sure your Rust toolchain is up to date:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   ```
3. Optionally, install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target if WebAssembly is required:
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
